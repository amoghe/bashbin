# bashext

A collection of useful bash extensions.

Typically this is cloned into my `~/bashbin`, and the `~/bashbin/source_me` file is sourced in `~/.bashrc`

## bin
This directory contains bins/executable files. So source_me will prepend this dir to your $PATH

## funcs
This directory contains files that should be 'sourced' into bash since they are utilities that operate by modifying the environment of the current shell.

## Note
A lot of the commands are nonsensical key sequences so as not to collide with other 'legitimate' commands or programs on my `$PATH`
